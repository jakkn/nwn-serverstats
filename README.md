# nwn-serverstats

Node.js web server using Express and Chart.js. Debugging with nodemon.

## Run
```
docker-compose up -d
```
The web server can be viewed on `http://localhost:3000/`

Note: -d in the above command is required as a bug workaround in docker-compose, sauce: https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/2338.
